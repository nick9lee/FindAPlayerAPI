add extention "/users" , "/chats", "/messages", "/comments", "/replys", "/posts", "/plays_sports", "/sports", "/roles", "/plays_roles", "/ratings" to see entire collection

EX: https://vast-meadow-12159.herokuapp.com/users to see all users, then add "/primarykey" of whatever the pk of the item you wnat is to get that particular item.

so if user had a UID of 1234, then use https://vast-meadow-12159.herokuapp.com/users/1234 to get that particular user
